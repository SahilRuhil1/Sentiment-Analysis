# Sentiment-Analysis
Developed an NLP pipeline to classify
 customer sentiment from Amazon product reviews. Performed web scraping,
 text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization), and exploratory data analysis.
 Built and compared multiple sentiment classifiers (Logistic Regression, Naive
 Bayes). Deployed the final model via Streamlit for real-time review sentiment
 prediction. This project focused on capturing customer feedback trends and
 improving user experience insights.
